# Project Progress

## Current milestone

Physically testable RadioLab v0.1 foundation.

## Current state

- Repository architecture and working model defined.
- Native ESP-IDF scaffold implemented for classic ESP32 / ESP32-PICO-D4.
- ESP-IDF 5.5.5, M5Unified 0.2.22, and M5GFX 0.2.29 are pinned.
- Minimal `board`, `radio`, and `protocol` boundaries implemented.
- RadioLab uses the same firmware on both equal peers.
- Versioned DISCOVERY bootstrap, one active peer, PING, application ACK, HELLO, RSSI capture, RTT, recent reachability, and explicit NORMAL/LR selection are implemented.
- The field-test UI uses the physically verified user-button mapping: primary (M5-marked) = PING, secondary (opposite side) = HELLO, secondary long = NORMAL/LR; the separate power button is not an application control.
- ESP-NOW callback-owned RX data and metadata are copied into a FreeRTOS queue before callback return.
- The two RadioLab user-button positions are physically verified on the M5StickC Plus SE; remaining hardware and radio behavior still requires field verification.
- A local ESP-IDF build has not yet been executed in the available implementation environment.

## Next planned implementation step

- Build with ESP-IDF 5.5.5.
- Flash the same firmware to both M5StickC Plus SE devices.
- Verify LCD behavior with the physically mapped primary/secondary controls.
- Verify buzzer and battery/AXP192 information.
- Verify automatic peer discovery on channel 6.
- Verify PING -> application ACK, local ACK RSSI, peer-reported PING RSSI, and RTT.
- Verify the simplified field screen, HELLO latch/dismiss behavior, and secondary-long mode switching.
- Walk with either unit and verify link freshness loss/recovery.
- Verify NORMAL and Espressif LR separately on physical hardware.

## Known blockers

No architectural blocker is known. Compile-time validation and physical device verification remain pending.
